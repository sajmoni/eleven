> Effortlessly build command line apps, with compile and run time type-safety by default

## :sparkles: Features

### Minimal and simple API

Only top level commands are allowed

### Aliases

### Auto-generated help and version

### No "string" APIs

### Fully typed arguments in runtime and dev

No other CLI framework does this yet

### Auto-complete (maybe)

### Automatic runtime type validation and error messages

### Automatic help and version generation

On by default

### Optional interactiveness built-in

Use ink for this to navigate help section interactively

### Message when CLI version is outdated

Use: https://github.com/sindresorhus/latest-version

This should run in a separate thread to now slow down main functionality, and should be opt-in

### Hints when command is misspelled

Inspiration: https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/latest/lib/utils/did-you-mean.js

### Watch mode

See how changes to your CLI immediately updates the help section

### Color output

Needs to be able to be turned off (respect environment variables?)
